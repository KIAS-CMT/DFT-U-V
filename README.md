# DFT-U-V

This is a repository of DFT+U+V patch file to Quantum Espresso version X.XX

When you use this patch file to perform first-principles calculations with self-consistent extended Hubbard interactions and then, obtain results, cite following two papers:

[1] S.-H. Lee and Y.-W. Son, "First-principles approach with a pseudohybrid density functional for extended Hubbard interactions", Phys. Rev. Research 2, 0434210 (2020)

[2] W. Yang, S.-H. Jhi, S.-H. Lee, and Y.-W. Son, "Ab initio study of lattice dynamics of group IV semiconductors using pseudohbyrid functionals for extended Hubbard interactions", Phys. Rev. B 104, 104313 (2021).

If you use a subroutine for spin-orbit interaction with extended Hubbard interactions, cite following one paper together with two papers above. 

[3] W. Yang and Y.-W. Son, " Effects of self-consistent extended Hubbard interactions and spin-orbit couplings on energy bands of semiconductors and topological insulators", Phys. Rev. B 110, 155133 (2024).
